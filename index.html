                                Based on five decades of coffee art, we set out to create an espresso that offers a
                                smoother, more balanced flavor in your cup and blends perfectly with the milk. We
                                combined
                                selected beans from different areas of the Latin American region, and then carefully
                                roasted
                                them to bring out their sweet and vibrant notes. The result is a deliciously round and
                                versatile coffee: delicious hot or served over ice.

                                Café Kenya is recognizable thanks to its characteristic citrus and grapefruit flavor,
                                with
                                occasional hints of lemon and bitter orange. This coffee has a bright acidity. This is
                                why
                                drinking it is so refreshing. In fact, it's great over ice on a hot summer's day.
                                Kenya continues to amaze our expert tasters and customers since 1971, with exotic
                                flavors
                                that no other coffee possesses.

                                Hailing from the Sumatra area of the Asia Pacific region, it has a dense, creamy body
                                with
                                virtually no acidity, allowing the flavor and intensity of the coffee to linger on the
                                palate. Concentrated herbal notes and an earthy aroma are evident, distinctive marks
                                that
                                this delicious coffee has left in our hearts.

                respects that connection, from our commitment to the highest quality coffee to the way we engage with
                our customers and communities to do business responsibly. From the beginning of Starbucks when we only
                had one store, every place we've been and every place we've opened, we've tried to make it a little
                better than we found it.</p>

                <p class="paragraph-main-history-4 p-3 fs-6 w-80">When the first Starbucks store opened in 1971, our
                    company was that one store in Seattle's historic Pike Place Market. From a narrow counter, Sarbucks
                    offered some of the finest coffee beans in the world. The name, inspired by Moby Dick, evoked the
                    romance of the high seas and the seafaring tradition of early coffee traders.</p>

            <p class="paragraph-main-history-5 p-3 fs-6">In 1981, Howard Schultz (former Chairman and CEO of Starbucks)
                walked into a Sarbucks store for the first time. From his first cup of Sumatra, Howard was strongly
                attracted to Starbucks and joined a year later.</p>

                <p class="paragraph-main-history-6 p-3 fs-6 w-80 text-end">In 1983, Howard traveled to Italy and was
                    captivated by Italian coffee shops and the romance of the coffee drinking experience. He had a
                    vision to bring that tradition of Italian cafés to the United States. He wanted to create a place
                    for conversation and a sense of community, a third place between work and home. He left the company
                    for a short period of time to start his own Is Giornale coffee shops and returned in August 1987 to
                    buy Starbucks with the help of local investors.</p>
